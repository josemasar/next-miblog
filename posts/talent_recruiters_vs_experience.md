title: 'Talent Recruiters vs Experience'

The other day I had a gentle conversation with a Talent recruiter from a leading **e-commerce** company based in my city. I was asking him about what kind of position I could send my applications to based on my profile. Sometimes job titles are totally confusing and you need some inside knowledge to know what level this job is. 

He kindly responded that for a role like **business analyst**, it is required knowledge of a programming language like python -which I have thanks to Datacamp - and experience with SQL databases -which I can also tick out as I am currently leading a business intelligence project. Great! I had in my resume what is being asked in this company to jump into e-commerce, but -and here is the downside and the reason for this reflection- I should not aspire to any degree of seniority as I would be entering into a new and completely different sector. I dedicated the last 9 years of my life to work in the aerospace industry where I contributed with the best of my efforts that airlines and business jets can fly and my company can make money for such incredible products and services.  However, this experience worthâ€™s nothing when the product to sell is a washing machine or a beautiful pair of leather shoes. Statistics, mathematics and algorithms are not universal knowledge. I am obviously being sarcastic at this point.

The majority of the jobs are asking for a **resolutive person** who is able to find solutions to problems. This statement can be found in different shapes and form, but always with this very exact meaning. How do people normally find solutions to problems in the business? Is it an innate skill that you might or might not have? Can you learn to find solutions?  Probably there will be extensive studies to respond to these questions, but I will give my opinion to this respect. 

To find solutions to new problems, you need primarily two things: power of abstraction and creativity. I understand **power of abstraction** as the ability to imagine how a system works and the possibility to alter its behavior by considering a number of variables and changing certain parameters. Everybody should have in mind now a black box with an input and output row. Moreover, **creativity** is the power to create something novel and it is known that Mr creativity shows up when, for instance, a routine is changed and the brain has to adapt to these new circumstances. The question I raise at this point is: would I make a better job in a e-commerce role if had worked for a e-commerce company for the last 9 years?  

My second general appreciation after my conversation with the Talent recruiter was the **level of specialization** which is being asked in job adverts. So you need SQL and two libraries in python to get the job. Hold on! Even if I knew nothing about these two languages, but had built things with other database type and had written scripts with any other major programming language, how long will it take me to learn what you're asking for? I understand companies need specific skills for a short on-boarding experience to deliver asap and maximize efficiency. However, can a strong candidate be rejected because he or she is missing a 20-60 hours course on a specific language, framework, library, API or software tool? What is worth of the general knowledge acquired in an engineering or master of science degree? Are we just defined by what we have studied? When do we stop learning? 

In my opinion, most of the job adverts are missing two very important skills:

First: Are you willing to **learn continuously** until the last day of your work in this company and be open to changes and think different if the task requires you to do so? How good can you adapt to change? 

Second: Are you a **team worker** and understand the power of the team paddling altogether to a common objective? How strong can you make your team regardless of your hierarchical level? 

**Conclusions:**

If I were a talent recruiter, I would look for someone who has knowledge in different disciplines and ask him or her why would you like to **learn about this role** you are applying for in this specific sector. A specific knowledge shouldn't be a barrier when the candidate demonstrates a deep knowledge in similar or related fields. Is anyone born as an engineer? Study, effort and merit is the right path to look for good luck and opportunities. Surely good luck will find you one day.

And second and the outmost important, a job can be made easy or extremely tedious depending which character faces the role. A person who **seeks for simplicity**, brings good ideas to resolve issues, knows how to think, proves him or herself right or wrong and asks for "even better if" feedback to the colleagues is the right candidate for a vast majority of the high performing engineering roles.

Last paragraph. My wife said to me once that if I make the interviewer **laugh**, I am almost at the next step in the recruiting process, almost about to hold the pen to sign the contract. So don't forget to learn JavaScript and React and nothing else than JavaScript and React, you will get your dream job anywhere you want. ðŸ˜„

Good luck to everyone looking for a new challenge in these uncertain times. Show the best part of you to the recruiters. Positiveness sells! And make them laugh!

Thanks for reading!
